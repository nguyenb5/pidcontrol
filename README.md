# PID Loop Control for DC motor

This project has several purposes. First, it emphasizes the importance of teamwork also simulates the teamwork environment where conflict might occur. From the start, we needed to establish team standards based on experience with the past project from the lab. Secondly, the project showed the importance of
documentation, like a schematic, bill of materials, block diagram, and timesheet. Thirdly, from
the technical side of the project, the team learnt more about PID loop control and practiced the
concept to make a servo out of a regular DC motor.

My main task in the project was the technical expert who made decision on which part will be used as well as writing the code for PDI control from scratch.
